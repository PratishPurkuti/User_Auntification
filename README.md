# User_Auntification
This is a c program with 3 predetermined users and their password which can be found in the code. 
here the user should enter their username and password when prompted and the bank balance of the user will be displayed. 
then the user will be able to withdraw or deposit money.  
*****few things to keep in mind.****
1) though the program shows updated bank balance in the terminal after withdrawing or depositing the values of it in the code doesn't actuallly change.
2) This is just a demo and you shouldn't keep your username and password in the code. specially without encryption.
